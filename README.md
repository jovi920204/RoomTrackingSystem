# Read Data in Google Sheets Using Python
## Approch
1. In order to get the data in google sheets, we need to use the Google API, let we can have right to connect python and google sheets.
2. Create a class object, it can connect to the Google sheet with its "id", in URL.
3. When we get data, transform to pandas, it's better for me to do my work. Like, data analysis.
